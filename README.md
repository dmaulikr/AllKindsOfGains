## All Kinds Of Gains (Fitness iOS App)

A minimalistic workout app built with a simple interface that allows users to create an account to track weight progress, log workouts,and add photo progress of themselves. Bulit in XCode, using Swift and Parse a back-end cloud database.Try it out and contact me if you have any feedback or want to learn more about how I built it please feel free to contact me.

## Motivation

I was constantly storing my workouts in the notes app provided by Apple and it got messy from time to time. Tried looking for solutions in the AppStore but all were too complicated or only had one of the features I wanted. Then I just decided to solve this problem my making my own app, and that resulted in All Kinds of Gains.
